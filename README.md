# Le Burger

_Le Burger_ is a full-stack, French-inspired burger site that allows the user to type in the name of whatever burger they would like to devour.  

It was created using Javascript, JQuery, Node.js, Express.js and the Bootstrap CSS framework.  It's deployed on Heroku.

After entering a burger name in the bottom input box, the _Fresh Burger_ list populates with the users' burger name.

The application then allows the user to devour whichever _Fresh Burger_ they like. This, pushes the burger to the _Devoured Burger_ list. Here, they can delete whichever _Devoured Burger_ they like.
